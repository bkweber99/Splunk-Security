<h1>Splunk Security</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Within this project I go through a fake company's Windows and Apache logs to analyze where and when an attack had occured. Using splunk I was able to pinpoint the attack and create reports and alerts to notify when another may occur. This was also done as a presentation which I had some fun with at the end!
